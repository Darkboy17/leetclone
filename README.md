## Features
**User Authentication**: The application uses Firebase for user authentication. It checks the authentication state of the user and redirects them to the home page if they are already authenticated.

**Particle System**: The application uses a custom Particle system for the landing page. It is completely written with Vanilla JS and no graphic libraries were used. Users can also interact with the Particles forming the message just for playability.

**Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and it adjusts the layout based on the window size.
